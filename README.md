# Hugo Relearn Theme

A documentation theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

![Overview](https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn/raw/main/images/screenshot.png)

## Motivation

The theme initially was a fork of [hugo-theme-learn](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn) with the aim of fixing long outstanding bugs and adepting to latest Hugo features.
