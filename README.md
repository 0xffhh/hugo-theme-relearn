## Releasing

We are using [gren](https://github.com/github-tools/github-release-notes) to generate the changelog and releasenotes automatically.

In the latest gren release (0.17.3) is a bug in the date generation. Therefore we are using a historical but correct version directly thru `npx`.

Once:

- Generate API Token as described in grens [README.md](https://github.com/github-tools/github-release-notes)
- On Windows do `setx GREN_GITHUB_TOKEN <API TOKEN>` and restart your shell

Per release:

- Close all issues of the milestone or push them back to an open milestone
- Close the milestone
- Tag and push the repo

  ```shell
  git tag <tag>
  git push origin <tag>
  ```

- Generate CHANGELOG.md with _gren_

  ```shell
  npx github-release-notes@0.17.1 changelog --tags=all --generate --override
  ```

- Add the changelog to git and update the tag

  ```shell
  git add CHANGELOG.md
  git commit -m "Ship tag <tag>"
  git push origin main
  git tag -f <tag>
  git push --force origin <tag>
  ```

- Generate release with _gren_

  ```shell
  npx github-release-notes@0.17.1 release --tags <tag>
  ```
